# Multivariate Polynomials
Project for the *Programming Paradigms* course (S1, 2017), from my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science](https://github.com/avivace/compsci).

Two libraries (Prolog and Common Lisp) to manipulate multivariate polynomials.
Available predicates allows parsing, sorting, operations(sum, product), evaluating and printing polynomials.
