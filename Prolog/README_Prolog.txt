norm_m/2
Monomial normalisation consists in simplifying the monomial
and reordering its variables in a lexicographical order.

norm_p/2
Polynomial normalization consists in removing monomials with coefficient 0,
simplifying similar monomials, and reordering them by descendant grade.
When monomials have the same total degree, they should be discriminated
by lexicographical order. Note that a last monomial normalisation is
needed for the cases in which new monomials appears from simplifying.
